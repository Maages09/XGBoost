# Titanic Machine Learning Project

## Introduction

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts survival on the Titanic. The analysis is performed using the XGBoost algorithm within a Jupyter Notebook.

## File Descriptions

- `train.csv` - This file contains the training set for the Titanic data. It includes passenger information along with the survival outcome.
- `test.csv` - The test set for the Titanic data. It contains passenger information but without the survival outcome.
- `gender_submission.csv` - An example of what a submission file should look like. It contains a set of passenger IDs and the corresponding survival predictions.
- `XGBoost_Titanic.ipynb` - A Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis process, from data cleaning and preprocessing to model training and evaluation using XGBoost.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or use Jupyter Lab or Google Colab to open the `.ipynb` file.
3. Install the necessary Python packages listed in the Requirements section.
4. You can run the Jupyter Notebook cell-by-cell to understand the analysis and modeling steps.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
